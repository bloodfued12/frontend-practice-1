# Frontend Practice

##  <Onboarding Site>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
This project is here to help practice my skills as a frontend webdeveloper taking into account everything I need to do and that I have learned from the course I started in October.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
I built this site since it's relatively simple looking but will allow me to familiarise myself with the concepts that were covered in my recent course.


- What did you learn?


## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```





## Features

## How to Contribute

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
